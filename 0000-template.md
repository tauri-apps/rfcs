# Summary

One paragraph explanation of the feature.

# Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What will developers, end-users and core-devs gain from this? What is the expected outcome?

# Guide-level explanation

- Explaining the feature largely in terms of examples.
- If applicable, provide sample error messages, deprecation warnings, or migration guidance.
- If applicable, describe how this feature can be taught to existing and new Tauri developers.
  
# Reference-level explanation

The technical portion of the RFC. Please explain in detail:

- How the feature interacts with other features.
- That it is reasonably clear how the feature would be implemented.
- Any corner cases should be covered by examples.
- Does this require stale dependencies to be forked? What is the long-term impact on core-developers? Does this introduce additional maintenance load? 

The section should return to the examples given in the previous section, and explain more fully how the detailed proposal makes those examples work.

## Platform Considerations

Tauri works across a wide variety of platforms (Operating Systems, Architectures, Hardware Configurations). Please explain:
- If applicable, how this feature interacts with different platforms and wether some platforms introduce special behavior.
- If this feature can only be supported on a subset of platforms, explain why.

## Security Considerations

Tauri is a very security conscious project. Please explain in detail:
- How does this feature impacts the security of Tauri apps.
- If applicable, what design decisions you have taken to increase the security of this feature and Tauri apps at large.
- If it's clear that this feature will require the addition of new dependencies, how this feature impact Tauris risk of supply chain attacks.

## Performance Considerations

How will this feature impact the performance of a Tauri app?

## Community Considerations

How does this impact community libraries, tools and other work? Does this invalidate existing tutorials and learning materials? 

# Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?
What are the limitations of this approach?

# Rationale and alternatives

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?
- If this is a language proposal, could this be done in a library or plugin instead?

# Prior art

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal.
A few examples of what this can include are:

- For community proposals: Is this done by some other community and what were their experiences with it?
- For other teams: What lessons can we learn from what other communities have done here?
- Papers: Are there any published papers or great posts that discuss this? If you have some relevant papers to refer to, this can serve as a more detailed theoretical background.

# Unresolved questions

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process before this gets merged?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation of this feature before stabilization?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this RFC?
